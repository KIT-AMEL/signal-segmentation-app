# signal-segmentation-app

The Signal Segmentation App enables users to upload, visualize, and segment signal data. 
Version 1.0 supports a single signal file with interactive segmentation via a range slider and the ability to save the segmented portion. 
Version 2.0 enhances this functionality by handling three signals simultaneously, providing individual plots, shared segmentation controls, and separate save options for each signal.
